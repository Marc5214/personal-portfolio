        <blockquote class="quote">"Believe you can and you're halfway there." <cite class="quote_author">-Theodore Roosevelt</cite></blockquote>
        <h2>A bit of dreaming...</h2>
        <p class="story">"Sometimes I imagine living in the future, around a year like 2,250. An average lifespan is like a few hundred years, you got more time spending with your nexts. The humanity is living peacefully, spreading to multiple planets in the whole galaxy. I see myself flying in a spaceship, and looking to the stars, far away, but even so close. It feels like I am an extremly small part of that bg system, as it doesn't matter what we do and who we are, but my experience says it doesn't. I know I have the possibility to make a change in the world, no matter how big. I know it, because I already did."</p>

        <p>This sounds like science fiction, but, hey, why shouldn't be we looking forward a scientific future where all those big problems are solved?</p>
        <h2>How I am going to make it anyway</h2>
        <p>My goals are participating in the development of sustainable healthcare products, multiplying the average lifespan of a human, flying through space and see the colonization of the mars with my own eyes, not just in movies.
        I want to manage leading companies, learn more about mathematics, use artificial intelligence to make our life easier and revolutionize the education of every person, every child on this planet, because I truly believe, education is for everyone.</p>

    <section class="highlights">
        <p>If I decide to do anything, no matter how demanding it might be for my age, how many time it might take or how difficult it is for one single person, I am simply going to make it.
        The point is, I teached myself to build that kind of an unbreakable mindset helping you to push through it, whatever it takes. I am motivated, I never give up.
        Further, my motivation is contagious, I'm recognizing again and again that people next to me do join the process, it's like a domino.</p>
        <p class="story">You need to know, I am really into mathematics. Currently, I am learning about contents from an intermediate math study courses, while I'm three and a half years away from graduation.
        Same happens to programming.
        So I was participating in a math competition on a national level, and there were nearly a dozen of students from my school participating with me, as they got to know how much fun I had doing this.</p>
