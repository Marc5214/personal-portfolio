      <h3>Why I really started programming</h3>
       <blockquote class="quote">"Okay, please don't laugh at me for that story"<cite class="quote_author">-Me, again</cite></blockquote>
      <p>As mentioned in my bio, I was a bit addicted to a mobile game called "Clash of Clans". I played that game a few hours every day, and I was a really good gamer. You need to know, the game consists of fighting other players and building an own clan.</p>
      <p>That's when programming came to my mind. I wanted to create a website for my clan, being able to organize and manage it better and find more amazing other gamers. Finally, I figured out, how to build a website and even programmed it, but (honestly, thanks to my parents), it never launched. However, I even build an application modelling the algorithm of the game, telling me which opponent I should battle with, which to skip, which buildings to upgrade and so on. I became an amazing gamer.</p>
      <p>(Glücklicherweise), I got rid(richtiges Wort?) of that addiction by time. At one moment, sitting in my bed and losing a battle and 3.30am, I felt like I had (keine Lust mehr) playing that game.</p>
      <p>But, the point was, I started programming.</p>
